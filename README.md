# 📧 Enterprise Phishing Risk Mitigation & Governance Program

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **managerial security control program** to reduce organizational phishing risk through governance, policy enforcement, training oversight, and executive reporting.

Unlike purely technical phishing labs, this initiative emphasizes:

- Governance
- Risk management
- Measurable KPI reduction
- Executive visibility
- Framework alignment

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

Phishing remains the leading initial attack vector for:

- Credential compromise  
- Business Email Compromise (BEC)  
- Ransomware deployment  
- Data exfiltration  

Without structured managerial controls:

- Users inconsistently report phishing attempts  
- Training lacks measurable outcomes  
- Leadership lacks risk visibility  

---

## 🧭 Framework Alignment

This program aligns with:

- NIST SP 800-53 (AT, PM, IR Controls)
- CIS Control 14 – Security Awareness & Skills Training

---

## 🛑 Risk Statement

> If phishing awareness and reporting controls are not formally governed, the organization may experience credential compromise, financial fraud, regulatory penalties, and reputational damage.

- Likelihood: High  
- Impact: High  
- Inherent Risk: Critical  
- Target Residual Risk: Moderate
